🕷️ Catch The Insect – Mini Game

A fun and interactive browser-based game where you try to catch insects as they randomly appear on the screen. The faster you are, the higher you score — but beware, the game gets chaotic very quickly!

This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to demonstrate DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple game mechanics.
